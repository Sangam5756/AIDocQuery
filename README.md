## Why This System? (The Need)

### ✅ Problem
People often have huge PDFs—books, reports, manuals—but finding specific information inside them is time-consuming.

### ❌ Traditional Approach
- Read the entire PDF manually.
- Use `Ctrl + F` with keywords (not smart, doesn’t understand context).
- It’s inefficient and doesn’t support natural language questions.

### ✅ Solution: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
This project solves that by combining **semantic search (FAISS)** with **language generation (Cohere)**:
- You ask a natural question.
- The system finds the most relevant document.
- The AI answers using only that context.

## 💪 Advantages

### 🔍 1. **Semantic Search** using FAISS
- Finds **conceptually similar** matches (not just exact keywords).
- Faster and smarter than linear search.

### 🧠 2. **Context-Aware Answers** using Cohere
- Answers questions **in natural language**.
- Generates context-specific responses from the document.
- Doesn’t hallucinate—thanks to the prompt limiting it to **only the document**.

### 💾 3. **Persistent Memory**
- FAISS index and `.pkl` file persist across server restarts.
- Supports multiple documents being indexed.

### ⚙️ 4. **Modular Architecture**
- Easy to scale (add chunking, file types, frontend, database).
- Clean folder structure (routes, services, utils) helps in team development.
